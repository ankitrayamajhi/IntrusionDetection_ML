- `models/`: Stores trained models and the scaler model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code organized into subdirectories for data processing, models, evaluation, and utilities.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the codebase.
- `results/`: Results from experiments, including metrics and plots.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
